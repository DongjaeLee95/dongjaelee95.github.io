excerpt: "Man-made objects and buildings exhibit a clear structure in the form of orthogonal and parallel planes. This observation, commonly referred to as the Manhattan-world (MW) model, has been widely exploited in computer vision and robotics. At both larger and smaller scales, the scale of a city, indoor scenes or smaller objects, a more flexible model is merited. Here, we propose a novel probabilistic model that describes scenes as mixtures of Manhattan Frames (MF) - sets of orthogonal and parallel planes."

Man-made objects and buildings exhibit a clear structure in the form of orthogonal and parallel planes. This observation, commonly referred to as the Manhattan-world (MW) model, has been widely exploited in computer vision and robotics.
