State-of-the-art visual odometry algorithms achieve remarkable efficiency and
accuracy. Under realistic conditions, however, tracking failures are inevitable
and to continue tracking, a recovery strategy is required. In this paper, we
propose a relocalization system that enables realtime, 6D pose recovery for
wide baselines. Our approach targets specifically resource-constrained hardware
such as mobile phones. By exploiting the properties of low-complexity binary
feature descriptors, nearest-neighbor search is performed efficiently using
Locality Sensitive Hashing.
