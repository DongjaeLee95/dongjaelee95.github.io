We propose a probabilistic generative model for inferring semantically-informed
aerial reconstructions from multi-modal data within a consistent mathematical
framework. The approach, called Semantically Aware Aerial Reconstruction
(SAAR), not only exploits inferred scene geometry, appearance, and semantic
observations to obtain a meaningful categorization of the data, but also
extends previously proposed methods by imposing structure on the prior over
geometry, appearance, and semantic labels.
