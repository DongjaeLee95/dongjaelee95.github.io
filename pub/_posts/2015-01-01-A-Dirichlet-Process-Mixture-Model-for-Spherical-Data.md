Directional data, naturally represented as points on the unit sphere,
appear in many applications. We propose a Dirichlet process mixture
model of Gaussian distributions in distinct tangent spaces (DP-TGMM) to
the sphere and develop an efficient inference algorithm. We demonstrate
that, unlike related work, the proposed probabilistic model can
represent anisotropic distributions on the sphere while still
respecting the underlying geometry and readily extends to
high-dimensional data.
