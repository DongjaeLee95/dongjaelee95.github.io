Based on the small-variance limit of Bayesian nonparametric
von-Mises-Fisher (vMF) mixture distributions, we propose two new
flexible and efficient k-means-like clustering algorithms for
directional data such as surface normals. The first, DP-vMF-means, is a
batch clustering algorithm derived from the Dirichlet process (DP) vMF
mixture. Recognizing the sequential nature of data collection in many
applications, we extend this algorithm to DDP-vMF-means, which infers
temporally evolving cluster structure from streaming data.
