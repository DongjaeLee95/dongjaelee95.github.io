Kno.0Bot was designed to collect wooden bricks from a special location
on a playground and to bring them to a predefined location. To get to
that goal the robot had to find its way over a bridge and through a
bunch of obstacles. Later Kno.0Bot was adapted to compete in the same
tea light collecting competition as Ca3505, the robot I built before
Kno.0Bot.
