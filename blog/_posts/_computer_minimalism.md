Lately I have been thinking a lot about minimalism, how to incorporate
more of it into my life and where it is already present.

The way I use my computer has been trending towards more and more
minimalistic ever since I started graduate school. My usage is tailored
to coding, writing and editing text, email and research on the
Internet. The corner stones of my minimalist computer usage are:

* awesome wm desktop manager for linux
* vim for all text editing (like really all of it - even email)
* mutt for email
* tmux for running and testing code (tmux-vim integration)
* fzf fuzzy finder to eliminate the need for retyping commands or paths

Currently I am using linux with the Awesome WM desktop environment. It
is a minimalist automatically tiling desktop manager. That means I
dont have to arrange windows to be visible. Ever. It automatically
arranges windows to fill all available screen space according to some
tiling scheme, that can easily be changed.
This eliminates all the overhead of having to align, resize and make
visible whatever window you are working on currently. It also always
automatically means I am always using 100% of the available pixels of
my monitor. This means I can productively and comfortably work on the
12.1'' (!?? TODO) monitor of my beloved X220 Thinkpad or a single 24''
rotated screen at work.

I love vim. It embodies minimalism for text editing and coding. Using
plugins it can be adapted and extended to do anything you would want to
do with text. I mostly use [YouCompleteMe](), vim-tmux integration, and
[Run external command thing].
