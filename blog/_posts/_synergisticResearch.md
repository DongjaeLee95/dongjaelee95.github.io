Find a research buddy who complements your skill set to improve both of
your experience, learning and impact.

In the second year of my PhD, I had the good fortune to get to know
Trevor, who complements me: he is very strong
in math, where I am very strong in application and building systems.
He was encouraged by his advisor to reach out and collaborate with
somebody in my group. Initially we just went for lunch almost every
day and talked about ideas. Pretty quickly we came up with our first
[joint project]() which we ended up completing in about two weeks.
Sounds insane right? But that is just the power of putting
complementary skill sets to 100% utilization.
