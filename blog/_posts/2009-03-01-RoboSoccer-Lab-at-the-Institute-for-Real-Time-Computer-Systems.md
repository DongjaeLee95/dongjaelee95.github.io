title: Development of Robots and Software for the RoboSoccer Lab 
---
Under the supervision of Martin Schaefer, I developed the hard- and
software for the [RoboSoccer](http://www.rcs.ei.tum.de/en/Lehre/Labs/pr_rs/) lab. Work included the design of an adapter
board for the [Pololu 3pi
robot](http://www.pololu.com/catalog/product/975) to make Pololu 3pi controllable via
Bluetooth. On a central server, C++ code was implemented to allow
students easy control over a team of up to four robots. Communication
between the programs was enabled via the
[KogMo-RTDB](http://www.kogmo-rtdb.de/).
