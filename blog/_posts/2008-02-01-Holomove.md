Holomove is a robot with omnidirectional driving capability due to its
three omni-wheels. The aim was to enable omnidirectional visual sensing
as well, which would allow for full exploitation of the driving system.

demonstrating closed-loop position control using mouse sensor feedback!
Unfortunately, I had to stop the development in an early stage because
my studies at TU Munich started to consume a considerable amount of
time.
