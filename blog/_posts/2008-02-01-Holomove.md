Holomove is a robot with omnidirectional driving capability due to its
three omni-wheels. The aim was to enable omnidirectional visual sensing
as well, which would allow for full exploitation of the driving system.

The video below demonstrates closed-loop position control using mouse sensor feedback!
The controller is set to just keep the position of
the robot constant. Notice, that the robot is not controlling its
orientation. Hence the controller will bring the robot back to its
starting position, but with an arbitrary orientation.

Unfortunately, I had to stop the development in an early stage because
my studies at TU Munich started to consume a considerable amount of
time.
