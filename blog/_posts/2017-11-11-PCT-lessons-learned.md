Since I have been asked for multiple people, I am listing lessons I
learned on the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT): things I
changed, I would change, I would try, and things I would keep the same
in terms of gear and backpacking techniques.

{% include base_path %}

### Changes I made to my approach to hiking and my gear during the PCT:

* Changed long pants for *short running shorts and Patagonia Houdini wind pants*
  (warm enough and super light).
* Switched from cooking with a stove to *stove-less*: I realized that I was a huge hassle
  to warm up food just to leave it to cool down enough to eat - with
  cold soaking I get to camp and can start eating right away.
  Additionally, I did not have to worry about finding fuel in town.
* Changed my aluminum hiking poles to *carbon fiber hiking poles* (Black
  Diamond Carbon Z) after bending my aluminum poles in a river
  crossing. I found the carbon fiber poles to be significantly lighter
  and stable enough.
* *shipped my fleece home* (puffy or fleece either is enough but both are
  over kill except for high sierras in snow; I would do it the other
  way around next time (see below)).
* dropped all but *one stuff/compression sack* (had one waterproof 11l
  one for emergencies to keep my sleeping bag dry (but never needed it)
  and used my bug net to keep all the smaller stuff together).
* started using a *kevlar food bag* (Ursack) after I had mice in my tent twice
  (but I would try to get away with smell proof bags next time because
  the Kevlar is heavy).
* switched to /settled on *darn tough socks* (really tough!).
* started using a *buff* to keep my neck and throat warm starting in Oregon.
* once it got colder in the north I started using a *synthetic T-shirt
  base layer* in addition to my sun shirt.
* started using a *mylar ground sheet* after my mattress got punctured
  (mylar = rescue blanked which can be bought in a lot of towns to
  replace a broken one).
* used *calf compressions* to prevent shin splints (never got them) and
  Achilles tendon inflammation (stopped when I got the compressions).
* took *turmeric+pepper capsules* every day to keep inflammation down
  (probably helped stop Achilles tendon inflammation).
* sent back my silk sleeping-bag liner and used *only long Johns and long
  merino wool shirt during the night*. They added enough warmth and also
  protected my quilt from the worst dirt and sweat.

### Things I would do differently next time:

* get *transition prescription glasses* so I do not have to switch between glasses.
* use a *bivy + tarp combo* instead of my tent (lighter and faster than
  tent because tarp would not have been necessary for most of the
  trail).
* *just bring a fleece hoodie* (I used the Patagonia R1 but a lot of
  ultra light hikers I saw were using the [hoodie from
  Melanzana](http://melanzana.com/catalog/product_info.php/cPath/22/products_id/34?osCsid=b9d8ca4dbe3c2bdda9a168afbfa2d4b7)) as
  opposed to puffy (wet fleece still keeps warm and does not overheat
  as quickly if used in the morning for hiking).
* *leave Garmin inReach* at home (I felt save all the time and would
  not have needed it - I mostly brought it for my family and friends
  but it did add a lot of extra weight and hassle keeping it charged
  and logging positions) 
* bring *lightweight camp shoes* (the Huaraches made from old insoles and
  shoe laces - see below) for wet and cold sections (this year the High
  Sierra) so that my feet can be dry while making dinner.
* I would *start out stove-less* right away in the desert and only bring
  a stove in for the High Sierra if it is snowed in and cold and wet
  again. Otherwise I would go stove-less all the way.
* bring *sun-gloves* for the desert to avoid having super sticky hands
  from the sunscreen.

### Things I would try:

* I would try a *different lightweight backpack* (I used the ZPacks Arc
  Blast) that is made from more
  durable fabric (while Dyneema is super strong it is pretty bad when
  it comes to abrasion such as when you put your pack down somewhere).
  A lot of hikers this year were happy with [Superior Wilderness
  Design](https://www.swdbackpacks.com/backpacks) backpacks.
* I would try to *snack less and condense my eating* to a few meals in
  order to reduce the impact of all the sweet food on my teeth.
* I really enjoyed my La Sportiva Wildcat trail runners (I never got
  blisters) but I would try to find *more lightweight shoes* with an even
  wider toe box.
* I would try to use the *Patagonia Sunshade* fishing sun-shirt with hoodie instead
  of the sun shirt and the neck protection on the sun hat. The effect
  would be the same but I really liked the way the hoodie looked,
  that it protected the side of the face even better, and that it was
  one piece in the neck region - no need to worry about the proper
  alignment of the neck protection and the top of the shirt.

![Umbrella]({{ base_path }}/images/blog/pctGear/umbrella.jpg)

### Things I would keep the same next time:

* use *umbrella* for desert hiking: with [my
  umbrella](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001OPO7L8/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) up I could keep
  going through the worst mid-day heat in the desert where others were
  just lying around in the (rare) shade.
* *20F Enlightened Equipment quilt*: I only felt cold three nights in the
  icy and high altitudes of the high sierra. But I suspect that this
  was mostly because I did not get my feet out of my cold wet shoes
  quickly enough (I did not have the [Huaraches made from insoles and
  shoe
  laces](https://steemit.com/running/@qezzit/making-your-own-running-huaraches-part-2)
  that Nobody thought me to make)
* bring a *sun-hat* with protection for the neck and the side of my face.
  Pretty much eliminates the need for sunscreen in the face.
* bring a *SPF-50 sun shirt*. The sun-shirt was great for sun protection
  and I wore it for the entire hike (I added a synthetic base-layer
  later on when it got colder in the north).
* *short shorts*! Ventilation, quick drying, can wear long johns over them
  during the night and feeling the air on my legs felt like
  freedom. It was really hard to switch back to wearing "normal" long
  jeans after the hike.
* *Sawyer Squeeze water filter*: robust, fast (if back flushed enough)
  and great taste.
* One non-dirty water bottle for electrolyte tablets and the rest all
  dirty (drink directly out of them through the Sawyer Squeeze).
* bring a *360 camera* to capture the full situation with one click.
  Ideally I would bring a wide angle camera but those are usually very
  heavy. Since the Ricoh Theta is only ~7 oz (200g) it is a very
  portable option for capturing wider fields of view than a smart phone.
* *trash compactor bag* as a water-proof bag liner.
* *Guthooks* app for navigation.
* *Deuce of Spades* trowel.
* *rechargeable headlamp*. Just recharge at every stop - no need to worry
  about buying expensive AAA batteries.
* *inflatable sleeping pad NeoAir XLite*. Light, warm and great for side sleepers.
  Slightly annoying to blow up every evening but once I learned the
  trick to jut lie down already while inflating it got way more
  comfortable.
* RAVPower *6700mAh battery pack*. Most other hikers carried 10000mAh
  battery packs but I found the 6700mAh is sufficient even for 7 days
  without civilization if I keep my iPhone in airplane and battery
  saving mode.
* Small [dual USB 5V 2.4A fast
  charger](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01NBW1NJO/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).
  Having two USB outputs really helped charge all my electronics
  quickly in town when wall outlets are sparse.
