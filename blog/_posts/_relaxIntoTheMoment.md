We continuously experience situations that annoy us but changing them
is out of our control. Like for example sleeping in a room with a
snoring person, trying to work in a coffee shop with a very chatty and
loud couple on the next table, a noisy coworker.

Try to relax into the situation, fully accept it and feel compassion
for the other people and yourself as well. Tear down the mental
blockade of separation the you build up in the process of resisting the
situation. 

I have found this to be the single most effective way of dealing with
annoying situations out of my control. Suddenly the snoring becomes
mine and thus disappears, I feel happy for the chatty couple and they
dissolve, the I feel compassion for the noisy coworker and myself and
he fades.
