*Find out what is important to you and let go of everything else.*
(paraphrased from [Joshua Becker](http://www.becomingminimalist.com/becoming-minimalist-start-here/))

This key message of minimalism manifests itself in de-cluttering ones
life, giving away or selling un-needed things, letting go of projects
that don't add to ones life, and letting go of toxic or unhappy
relationships. It also means being content with having and needing
less.  In the last few months, I have been thinking about and
experimenting with this idea.

Having less stuff in my life is lets me enjoy and care for the things I
have more. It means focus and importance to the people and things that
remain. It is like shining a stage light onto them. 
I want to really talk to my friends and family and not just chit-chat.
I want to enjoy all my things as much as my puffy winter jacket that I
got a few years back. I still love wearing it every time. Recently, I
started taking better care of it: it has its own hanger in my closet
and I put it back there right when I come home. I don't just throw it
somewhere anymore. It is important to me.

Minimalism means less waisted energy and time on cleaning or taking
care of stuff I don't even enjoy. It means maximizing free time to enjoy
the important things in my life. It allows me to take 1h to 1:30h
every morning to meditate and/or run because these are very important
to me. Since there is less stuff distracting me at night, getting up
early and taking that time has been easy.

Less is beautiful. Since I donated five (yes five!) trash bags of
cloths, shoes and other stuff my room and shelves have more space and
no clutter. I love coming home to my room now. It is beautiful and
spacious.  The funny thing is I don't even remember what was in those
five trash bags.

I like where this path leads. I will keep walking.
