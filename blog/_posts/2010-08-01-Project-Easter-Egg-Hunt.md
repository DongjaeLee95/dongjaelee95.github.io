title: Project "Easter Egg Hunt"
---
Final project with Edward Macdonalds, Daniel Pickem and Kunal Muchhala
in Ayanna Howard's class 'Autonomous Control of Robotic Systems' at
Georgia Tech. In a simulated environment (Player & Gazebo), we enabled
a pioneer robot to autonomously explore its environment and collect and
retrieve colorful easter eggs to a base location. We deployed a SLAM
system, A* for path planning, a motion controller and computer vision
algorithms.
