Connectedness is crucial for leadership and mentoring.
The feeling of connectedness can be cultivated by meditation.
Here is how it manifested in my life.

In the fall of 2015, I started to mentor three undergraduate students
on two separate projects. As has repeatedly happened for my in fall, I
was overworked and stressed because of major conference deadlines and
an unusually high amount of travel to present previously published
work. This all led to me being mostly focused onto my own stress and
seeing the additional mentoring responsibility as a burden rather than
a fun additional task. Accordingly, I did not spend much time with my
mentees leaving them mostly unguided in their struggles.

Then in January 2016, I attended a meditation workshop during
MIT's IAP. Focused on developing happiness and satisfaction in live
through connectedness, service, yoga and meditation, the workshop
changed my life.
Soon I was finding myself spending more and more time with my mentees.
Taking the time to show them some C++ trick, helping them with some
tricky piece of math or giving them detailed feedback on their project
writeup.
I felt connected to them and with that came a profound sense of
responsibility. They were at a point in their education where all
the attention and feedback that I received from my mentors had a huge
impact on my way of working and thinking. I am deeply grateful for all
my mentors.
It became a way of giving back that felt deeply satisfying.
Seeing them succeed in the end (they all received awards for the work
from the department) was exhilarating.

After the workshop in January 2016, I kept practicing meditation every
morning and I am convinced that this was key to developing and
maintaining the feeling of connectedness. Feeling connected to a person
or a group directly translates into a feeling of responsibility which I
am convinced can be felt on the receiving side and probably motivates
as well.
