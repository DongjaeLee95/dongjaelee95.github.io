Connectedness is crucial for successful leadership and
mentoring since it directly leads to a sense of responsibility.
The feeling of connectedness can be cultivated by meditation, which at
its core is about dissolving the feeling of _self_ which often
separates us from others.
Here is how connectedness manifested in my life without active effort besides
daily meditation (no chanting or religious mumbo jumbo).

In the fall of 2015, I started to mentor three undergraduate students
on two separate projects. As has repeatedly happened for my in fall, I
was overworked and stressed because of major conference deadlines and
an unusually high amount of travel to present previously published
work. This all led to me being mostly focused onto my own stuff and
seeing the additional mentoring responsibility as a burden rather than
a fun opportunity to serve. Accordingly, I did not spend much time with
my mentees leaving them mostly unguided in their struggles.

Then in January 2016, I attended a meditation workshop during
MIT's independent activities period (IAP). Focused on developing
happiness and satisfaction in live through connectedness, service, yoga
and meditation, the workshop changed my life.
Soon, I was finding myself spending more and more time with my mentees.
Taking the time to show them some C++ trick, helping them with some
tricky piece of math or giving them detailed feedback on their project
writeup.
I felt connected to them and with that came a profound sense of
responsibility. They were at a point in their education where all
the attention and feedback that I received from my mentors had a huge
impact on my way of working and thinking. I am deeply grateful for all
my mentors. And helping my mentees became a way of giving back that feels deeply satisfying.
Seeing them succeed (they all received awards for the work
from the department) was an exhilarating side product.
I am convinced this connection can be felt on the receiving side as
well and it probably motivates as well.

Since the workshop in January 2016, I have been meditating every
morning and I am convinced that this was key to developing and
maintaining this feeling of connectedness not only with my mentees but
generally with the people in my life.
Feeling connected to a person directly translates into a
feeling of responsibility because you are not separate entities
anymore. Serving and helping her helps you both.
