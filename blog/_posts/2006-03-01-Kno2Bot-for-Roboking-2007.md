Kno.2Bot had a localization system based on its odometry and was able
to correct its position from distance measurements to the walls of the
known playground. A solenoid powered kicker enabled it to shoot
ping-pong balls. I was honored by my high-school for the term paper
about the construction and control of the robot
["Aufbau und Programmierung eines Wettbewerbroboters"](http://www.jstraub.de/download/Bau%20und%20Programmierung%20eines%20Wettbewerbsroboters%20von%20Julian%20Straub.pdf).
