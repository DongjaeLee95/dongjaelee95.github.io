excerpt: "developing artificial 3D perception"
---
In fall 2012, I joined [MIT](http://www.mit.edu/) to pursue a PhD in
Computer Science. Within the [Computer Science and Artificial
Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL)](http://www.csail.mit.edu/), I am
working with [John W. Fisher III](http://people.csail.mit.edu/fisher/)
and [John Leonard](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/marine/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page#Prof_John_J_Leonard).
On my way to MIT, I graduated from the [Technische Universität München (TUM)](http://www.tum.de) with a Diplom and the [Georgia Institute of Technology](http://www.gatech.edu/) with a
M.Sc. I am very grateful for the many friends, advisors and my family
which supported me on this journey.

## Developing artificial 3D perception

My interest in robotics originates from age 15, when I got my first
micro-processor from my father as a present. Since then I have built
seven robots from scratch and worked in multiple teams on robotics
related projects. 

My research interests in AI and robotics are in 3D
perception (point clouds and surface normals), modeling (directional
data and Bayesian nonparametrics), and inference (sampling,
optimization and low-variance asymptotics).
